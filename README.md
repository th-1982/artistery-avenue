## Design:
The website was designed to ensure users can easily browse through various posts, artworks, and creative content within the platform.
The website prioritizes a navigation system, allowing users to access all components easily. This includes straightforward paths to CRUD functionalities for managing their Posts, Comments, Likes, and Profiles.
The Users are also empowered to perform all CRUD functionalities, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting their Posts, Comments, Likes, and Profiles. This capability enhances user control and customization.
In addition to standard CRUD operations, Users incorporate specialized functionalities for CRU Reviews and Wall messages. This caters to the unique needs of the artistic community by fostering detailed reviews and interactions on user profiles.

Rather than prioritizing aesthetics like structure and colors, the developer's efforts are geared towards creating more components and their functionality and arranging them accordingly.
